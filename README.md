# Calorie Tracker Project 
### By Brian Kim, Hao Liang Cheng, and Zi Han Ding
This is a calorie tracker web application project. It contains basic features such as recording daily calorie gain/loss as well as user log in.
# Motivation
This is a coursework project, however we chose to create a calorie tracker as a team. Being assigned to the Health and Nutrition group, we chose to create a calorie tracker project because of its viable size and scope for a team of three for four sprints.
